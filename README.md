## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

- Use official base images and keep them up-to-date  
- Avoid running as root inside containers  
- Limit the number of layers and installed packages  
- Scan images for vulnerabilities regularly  
- Set explicit user permissions in the Dockerfile  
- Use multi-stage builds to reduce image size and attack surface
